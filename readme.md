# Pink Duck

An implementation of [this proposal](https://twitter.com/wasabiboat420/status/1335971580992745472) for vastly superior memonomics and quackonomy.

This repo contains a new token contract for Unit Protocol token which rebrands it as `DUCK (Unit Protocol)`.

The contract also includes a `migrate()` function which burns COL for DUCK at a 100:1 ratio, the same AAVE has used for [their migration](https://docs.aave.com/faq/migration-and-staking).

Mainnet deployment: [0x92E187a03B6CD19CB6AF293ba17F2745Fd2357D5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x92E187a03B6CD19CB6AF293ba17F2745Fd2357D5#code)
